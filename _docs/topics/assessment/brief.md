### Deadline

The **submission deadline is 12pm (Noon) on 24th May 2022**.  

The assessment should be submitted through Moodle and GitLab (or an appropriate alternative, check with me).  

### Overview

This module focuses on game engines and their role in the game development process. For this module you will engage will a game engine to develop a game. Through developing the game you will study aspects of the game engine (such as graphics rendering, animation, game physics and collision detection), evaluate the game engine’s approach to those aspects and use or work round them.  

This assessment comes in three parts.
1. A One Page game description/promo/elevator pitch for your game
2. A Game developed using a game engine
3. An essay describing the use of the game engine for your game

### 1. Game One Page

A One Page is a one page long document which shows the main features of your project and will let us stand out from the competition. It should be a brief, attractive and effective promotion for your game. It is used to “sell” the game concept to your team, your employers (if you work for a games company) or a games company/publisher if you are trying to find backing for your game.  

There is a guide to creating One Pages [here](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/how-to-design-your-one-page) and a gallery of one pages to inspire you [here](https://onepagelove.com/inspiration/game).

Your One Page should be a single page PDF file. It can be portrait or landscape layout. How you layout the page and exactly what you put on it is up to you but it should give a good overview of the game. Anyone looking at it should quickly grasp the game concept, its core loop, and its genre/theme.  

You are expected to have produced version one of your One Page by the class in week 4 (1st March 2022).  

The final version should be submitted through Moodle by the assessment deadline.  

### 2. A game developed using a game engine

In this module we are looking at development using game engines. The lectures will cover the different components of game engines. For the assessment you will use a game engine to develop a game.  

The game should involve extensive use of at least one component of the game engine. It should push your knowledge of that component, its capabilities and its limitations. Once you have your game concept you should consider what you need from a game engine and research which engine is most appropriate for the game.  

You can develop any game you wish. It can be a remake of an existing game or something original. You should check with the lecturer to ensure your choice is appropriate for this module.  

You can use any game engine that is freely available and can be run on the computers in the third year laboratory. (Your own laptop may be acceptable, but you will need to bring it in for the demonstration session).  

The following engines are acceptable :- Unreal, Unity, Godot, GameMaker Studio 2, Armory, CryEngine, Corona/Solar2D. If you are considering any other engine speak to the lecturer about it.  

You will need to demonstrate the game to the lecturer, the demonstration should include a discussion of the game engine, how well it supported your game concept and any problems you faced.  

### 3. Game Engine Essay

You have to write a 2000 word essay describing how you used your chosen game engine in developing your game. Your essay should include an overview of the core loop/gameplay of your game, an introduction to the engine and why you chose it. The majority of the essay should discuss the components of the engine used in developing the game. You should focus on which parts of the engine supported your game concept and any factors of the engine that hindered you.  

Your essay should include approariate images and diagrams and should be well referenced. The 2000 word limit is strict but extra material can be included in appendices. Diagrams, images, references and appendices do not count towards the word count.
